# [Project 1: Determining the type of satellite orbit on the basis of its location and parameters](https://github.com/pawelloo/ds_satellites_proj/blob/main/KNN_satelittes.ipynb)
For this example project I used database with more than 5000 satelites to simply determine satelite type of orbit. Dataset wasn't ready for use to machine learning algoritms, so I had to clean and preprocessed data. 
I used easy to implement KNN classifier that gives me 99% accuracy after minimal tuning. Such good result was obtain beacause parcticular type of orbit is relatively easy to predict based on parameters like perigee or apogee.

# [Project 2: Data visualisation in Tableau - Fatal road accidents in Europe](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pawel6908/viz/RoadaccidentsEurope/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
In this visualization, I used data collected from Eurostat and compared the mortality rate in road accidents in individual European countries. I compared 2014 with 2019, so we can see that the road fatality rate is decreasing and compared data on accidents from individual countries to the GDP per capita of a given country. We can notice a certain relationship between road safety and the scale of the country's development.
