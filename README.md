# [Project 1: Determining the type of satellite orbit on the basis of its location and parameters](https://github.com/pawelloo/ds_satellites_proj/blob/main/KNN_satelittes.ipynb)
For this example project I used database with more than 5000 satelites to simply determine satelite type of orbit. Dataset wasn't ready for use to machine learning algoritms, so I had to clean and preprocessed data. 
I used easy to implement KNN classifier that gives me 99% accuracy after minimal tuning. Such good result was obtain beacause parcticular type of orbit is relatively easy to predict based on parameters like perigee or apogee.
